## Overview

The goal of this project is to apply the learnings about data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas. The scope of this project will be based on a [messy data set](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/1) from Kaggle wich contains all Shark Attacks registered since 1900.

Throughout the cleaning process we will have to manipulate the data to test our hypothesis and once the cleaning process is finished conclude whether the hypothesis is true or not.


## Hypothesis to Test: Â¿Are American White Sharks More A ggressive?

Throughout the project we are going to analyze if there have been more attacks produced by white sharks in the United States vs. other countries (South Africa & Australia).
